This R package provides a template for data processing or analysis projects.

The template's folder structure was recommended by [Emily Riederer](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/team-of-packages/). Her descriptions of each subfolder appear in the `README.md` template created with each project.

You can install ermise directly from GitHub using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("szego/ermise")
```

After installing, create a new "ermise Project" using RStudio's new project wizard (`File > New Project...`).
